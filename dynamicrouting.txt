Static routes have to be setup manually.
Dynamic routing protocols are setup automatically.
The routers will share information with each other on dynamic routing.

In dynamic routing if a subnet goes down router will automatically figure out a new best path if one is available and this does not exist on static routing.

You can use static routing for backup purposes or for a static route to the internet.
